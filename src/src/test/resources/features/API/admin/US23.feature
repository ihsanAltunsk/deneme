Feature: US23 As an administrator, I want to be able to access detailed information about the
  department with the specified ID number via the API connection.

  Scenario Outline: TC01 Admin should be able to view and verify department information with valid authorization information and valid department id via API.
    * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
    * The api user sets "api/departmentDetails" path parameters
    * The api user prepares a GETBODY request containing the id = <id> and records the response.
    * The api user verifies that the status code is 200
    * The api user verifies that the message information in the response body is "success"


    Examples:
      | id |
      | 16 |
