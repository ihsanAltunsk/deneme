  Feature: As an administrator, I want to access the Refund & Reason List through the API connection.

    Scenario: When a GET request with valid authorization information is sent to the /api/refundReasonList endpoint,
             the returned status code should be verified as 200,and the message in the response body should be verified as "success".

     * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
     * The api user sets "api/refundReasonList" path parameters
     * The API user sends a "GET" request and records the response.
     * The api user verifies that the status code is 200
     * The api user verifies that the message information in the response body is "success"

    Scenario Outline: When a GET request containing valid authorization information is sent to the /api/refundReasonList endpoint,
            the returned information in the response body for the reason with ID 'x' should be validated.

     * The api user constructs the base url with the "admin" token.
     * The api user sets "api/refundReasonList" path parameters
     * The API user sends a "GET" request and records the response.
     * The api user validates the "<reason>" of the response body with index <dataIndex>.

     Examples:
      | dataIndex | reason              |
      | 0         | Product mismatch    |
      | 2         | Order wrong product |
